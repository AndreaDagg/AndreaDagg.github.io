## Abstract of the three-year thesis
In the field of cybersecurity, the term Malware refers to all programs developed with the intent to cause harm or put a computer system at risk. Malware can act at various levels and encompasses different categories of malicious software: Virus, Ransomware, Trojan, Worm, among others. Android OS is an operating system developed for mobile devices and is currently the most widely used due to being an open-source system not tied to specific hardware, making it installable on many devices. However, the popularity of Android is also due to the vast number of applications available today, which, if not installed from trusted sources, may lead to the intrusion of malicious code.

One method of hiding malicious code within Android applications is through "Colluding." In this case, the malicious code is divided across several applications that communicate with each other, exchanging sensitive information within hidden channels. This method bypasses security measures that rely on static analysis to detect the malicious behavior of a single application.

This leads to the motivation behind this project, which focuses on the classification of such threats, specifically starting from colluding APK files. The goal is to utilize machine learning techniques, specifically Multiple Instance Learning, for the classification of colluding applications affected by malware. The results achieved have been satisfactory, enabling the classification of colluding APK sets into different categories.
